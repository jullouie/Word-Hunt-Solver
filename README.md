# Word-Hunt-Solver
One easy way to win GamePigeon's Word Hunt game is to utilize this program.

In the Boggle-like game, given a 4x4 board of letters, you need to find as many words as you can in 90 seconds. Longer words give more points.
My program allows you to choose if you'd like the words to be given in order of prefix (easier to find the words on the game board in shorter time) OR in order of word length greatest to least (maximize points by word length).

This project uses words from the word.txt file to compile a trie. Then, using depth first search, my program will find all the valid words on the game board!
All you have to do is input them to win!
